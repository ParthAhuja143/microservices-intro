# DOCKER

## Flow

### Image
An image contains 2 things
    1. FS Snapshot - Resources and files to be needed
    2. Startup Command - To run the container

### containers
    1. Containers are isolated from one another

## CMD
> `docker run <image_name>` - Create and run a container
> `docker run <image_name> [optional]<overrided_cmd>` - How to overide a default command in a container
> `docker ps` - List all running containers
> `docker ps --all` - List all containers
> `docker create <image_name>` - Create a container
> `docker start <container_id>` - Run a container (executes startup cmd)
> `docker start -a <container_id>` - Run a container with output logs
> `docker run <container_id> [optional]<overrided_cmd>` - Run a container and override default cmd
> `docker system prune` - Delete all stopped containers, build cache
> `docker logs <container_id>` - Get logs from a container
> `docker stop <container_id>` - Stop a running container SIGTERM - to stop after ending a running process
> `docker kill <container_id>` - Stop a running container SIGKILL - to stop process imidiately
> `docker exec -it <container_id> <command>` - Execute additional command inside a container
> `docker exec -it <container_id> sh` - Get access to shell

# KUBERNETES
For orchestrating the different services and communication.
## How to create an image and run the image with kubernetes

> Go to the folder
> Run the Dockerfile and tag with the name same as infrastructure/ files (example : `docker build -t parthahuja143/posts-deploy:1.0.0 .` )
> Run the Deployment/Service/Pod (`kubectl -f apply deployment.yaml`)

## Updating the image used by a Deployment
### Method 1 (Not preferred)

> Run `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml` will output deployment configured and not created

### Method 2 (Preferred)

> Use latest image tags
> Don't tag images with the version numbers
> Build the images
> Push the image
> kubectl rollout restart deployment {deployment_name}

## Types of Services

1. Cluster IP - Let's Pods communicate inside the Cluster
2. NodePort - Let's Pods communicate with the outside world. Used mainly for development environment.
3. Load Balancer - Let's Pods communicate outside the cluster, requires more configs and works like NodePort.
4. External Name - Redirects an in-cluster request to an external CNAME url.
