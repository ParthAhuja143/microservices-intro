# DOCKER

## Flow

### Image
An image contains 2 things  
    1. `FS Snapshot` - Resources and files to be needed   
    2. `Startup Command` - To run the container  

### Containers
    1. Containers are isolated from one another  

## CMD
`docker run <image_name>` - Create and run a container  
`docker run <image_name> [optional]<overrided_cmd>` - How to overide a default command in a container  
`docker ps` - List all running containers  
`docker ps --all` - List all containers  
`docker create <image_name>` - Create a container  
`docker start <container_id>` - Run a container (executes startup cmd)  
`docker start -a <container_id>` - Run a container with output logs  
`docker run <container_id> [optional]<overrided_cmd>` - Run a container and override default cmd  
`docker system prune` - Delete all stopped containers, build cache  
`docker logs <container_id>` - Get logs from a container  
`docker stop <container_id>` - Stop a running container SIGTERM - to stop after ending a running process  
`docker kill <container_id>` - Stop a running container SIGKILL - to stop process imidiately  
`docker exec -it <container_id> <command>` - Execute additional command inside a container  
`docker exec -it <container_id> sh` - Get access to shell  
`docker build .` - Build your dockerfile to an image  
`docker build -t <docker_username>/<image_name>:<version_number> .` - Build an image and tag it  
`docker build -p <Outside_port>:<Port_inside_container> .` - Forward a request from outside port to inside a container port  
`docker push <image_id/tag>` - Push Image to dockerhub

# KUBERNETES
For orchestrating the different services and communication.  

Kubernetes has three Object Types you should know about:

1. Pods - runs one or more closely related containers  
2. Services - sets up networking in a Kubernetes cluster  
3. Deployment - Maintains a set of identical pods, ensuring that they have the correct config and that the right number of them exist.  
## Pods:
1. Runs a single set of containers  
2. Good for one-off dev purposes  
3. Rarely used directly in production  
## Deployment:
1. Runs a set of identical pods  
2. Monitors the state of each pod, updating as necessary  
3. Good for dev  
4. Good for production  

## CMD
`kubectl get pods/deployments/services` - Get info about the pods/deployments/services   
`kubectl apply -f <filename.yaml>` - Create a pod/deployments/services  
`kubectl describe pod/deployment/service <id>` - Get info about a kubectl object  
`kubectl delete pod/deployment/service <id>` - Delete a kubectl object  
`kubectl rollout restart pod/deployment/service <id>` - Restart a kubectl object  
## How to create an image and run the image with kubernetes

1. Go to the folder  
2. Run the Dockerfile and tag with the name same as infrastructure/ files (example : `docker build -t parthahuja143/posts-deploy:1.0.0 .` )  
3. Run the Deployment/Service/Pod (`kubectl -f apply deployment.yaml`)  

## Updating the image used by a Deployment
### Method 1 (Not preferred)
Run `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml` will output deployment configured and not created

### Method 2 (Preferred)
1. Use latest image tags  
2. Don't tag images with the version numbers  
3. Build the images  
4.  Push the image  
5. `kubectl rollout restart deployment {deployment_name}`  

## Types of Services

1. `Cluster IP` - Let's Pods communicate inside the Cluster
2. `NodePort` - Let's Pods communicate with the outside world. Used mainly for development environment.
3. `Load Balancer` - Let's Pods communicate outside the cluster, requires more configs and works like NodePort.
4. `External Name` - Redirects an in-cluster request to an external CNAME url.

### Load Balancer

1. Load Balancer Service  
Tells Kubernetes to reach out to it's provider (cloud provider) and provision a load balancer to communicate between our cluster and the outside world. Gets traffic inside a single pod.  
It is completely out of our cluster which contains our pods.  

2. Ingress  
A pod with a set of routing rules to distribute traffic to other services. 
Ingress forwards the request to the specific pod in the cluster from Load Balancer Service.   

## Communicate to a service ?

URL formed will be of type `http://<service_name>:<port>` so send the request to this URL.
